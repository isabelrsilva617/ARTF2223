			<h2>Banksy @ Nu</h2>
			<p>Banksy is known for his mysteriousness. He is rarely seen and leaves little signatures besides the overall style of his work. The artwork we see around Northeastern, while similar in style, are not true Banksy work. </p> 
			<p>For one, all of these works have a claimed artist working on them. Jeff Aerosol is behind all of these works. He is highlighted on Northeastern's page frequently and takes pride in his work. How is he not Banksy? Why can we not say maybe he has been Banksy all along? Jeff has his own signature on his art, red arrows. All of the Banksy-like art we see at Northeastern have a hidden arrow in the, a dead-tell that they are not Banksy art.</p>
